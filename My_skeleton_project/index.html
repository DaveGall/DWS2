			<h3>I am a Beginner</h3>
			<p>This is my first time using any type of skeleton.</p>
			<ol class="square">
				<li>I am just writing random things.</li>
				<li>The more I practice the better I will become.</li>
				<li>I practice every day.</li>
                <li>It takes me a little longer to grasp the terminology.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<div class="third-column">
			<h3>The More I Play</h3>
            <p>It seems the more I play with this skeleton the more I am learning. I think it is a good learning tool it my opinion.
            A great way to see what you like and don't like and how to do things that you maybe weren't sure of before. </p>
		</div>
        <div id="one-column">
            <h3>Just one Column Here</h3>
            <p>Set up as just one page width column that will serve some purpose for this site. I have no clue as to what I would put here other than an image or a great article that
                I have so awesomely authored. I believe when I am done with this assignment I will be playing with this a bit more because I have found that
                it is in a way helping me understand how to use different styles to perform certain tasks. It will be a bit better without the pressure of a due date. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="my-column">
            <h3>Part of a Two Column Section</h3>
            <p>Actually it is not a column just a big box with some random text that I have come up with. Come to think of it not even a lot of
            text, just a little bit. Come to think of it I hope that there isn't going to be a grammar check on this attempt at using skeleton
            as I have not been paying attention to my grammar. Although I must say it is quite pristine, flowing beautifully throughout the page
            and each column. It is almost as if I was a literary genius or something. </p>
        </div>
        <div id="sidebar">
            <h3>My Sidebar</h3>
            <p>This is a sidebar that will contain some text and probably some pictures.</p>
            <p>I would like to see if the sidebar will remain in the same place the more I type. So I am going to type out a long
            boring article that will please and amuse the masses....wait no sorry it's boring, it will be used to put children to
            sleep at night. Yes that will be the use of this article, you can always find a use for everything I tell you what.
            Especially if you just need to type something and you don't know that Latin thing that they always use as placeholder
            text. You know the Lorem ipsom text that just says stuff that may mean something but I have no idea because I can't read
            it. At least this is interesting placeholder text, well at least to me. </p>
        </div>


        <div id="footer">
            <h3>This will be my footer section</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#">Contact</a> </li>
                <li><a href="#">About</a> </li>
                <li><a href="#">Jobs</a> </li>
                <li><a href="#">Affiliates</a> </li>
