        <article>
            <p>Dobermans are given a bad rap when it comes to animals and violent acts. The news loves to victimize when it
            reports on incidents that are "news worthy." We have had Duke since he was six months old and he has been the
            friendliest dog we have had. He has never bitten anyone nor growled at anyone. Well unless we were being threatened and
            then he would raise up but he never attacked.</p>
            <p>Prior to having Duke we had a little Terrier that bit several people, which as a dog owner is the worst. You never
            want your pet to harm anyone, unless of course they are harming you.</p>
            <p>Since getting Duke or Doberman we have had many encounters with other Doberman owners and not one has ever growled
            at us. They are the friendliest dogs you will ever meet, they are just a happy breed. Whether it's walking on the street or at the dog park
            (where he is the biggest baby of them all) we have never had a problem.</p>
            <h2>Past Intentions</h2>
            <p>The biggest hurddle for Dobermans is what they were bred for in the first place. Dobermans are a German bred dog which was bred to protect
            and be agile enough to chase away a threat. Since this was the way they were bred that is how they came to be used in peoples homes. They were
            very protective of their owners property and their owners themselves.</p>
            <p>Growing up a good family friend had two pet Dobermans that protected their house and they were aggressive if they did not know you. This
            was the Doberman people grew up knowing and fearing. Well just like people animals can change also and over time we bred out the aggression
            and were able to make them loyal, loving family pets. I still say loyal because that is one trait that was not bred out of the Doberman, they
            are as loyal as ever, however they don't have that attack drive they once had.</p>

            <h2>Selective Breeding</h2>

            <p>Just as with roses Dobermans were selectively bred to gain the desired qualities of their owners. So to get for instance a "King Doberman"
            all they did was take a normal doberman that was abnormally large and breed them with another abnormally large Doberman. Thus eventually achieving
            the desired outcome of a larger (more intimidating) Doberman.</p>
            <p>It follows along the lines of the Russian experiment with wild Foxes. The idea was to see if they could domesticate a wild fox (these things were mean)
            through selective breeding. They captured a few wild Foxes and started breeding them, out of each litter the researchers took out the most docile
            offspring and bred them together. They continued this pattern over the years (50 years to be exact) and were able to effectively change the behavior
            of the fox. The Foxes natural coat even changed color and it became as docile as a house cat.</p>
            <p>On the flip side to this is the fact that the researchers also used the aggressive offspring to breed to see if it had any affect on the
            temperament of the foxes. The result of course was the researchers bred an incredibly volatile strain of wild fox. They were the complete opposite
            of the domesticated version and were even more aggressive than the local wild foxes around the facility.</p>
            <h2>Happy Owners, Happy Dogs</h2>
            <p>We could talk about breeding all we want and how it has effectively changed the Doberman, Pitbul and other "aggressive" dog breeds. What we can't
            change is one; peoples complete lack of wanting to educate themselves and two; the fact that there are folks out there in this world that do use
            certain breeds of dogs for exactly what we are trying to stop. Part of a dogs state of being comes from the owner themselves and some people just don't
            get that. If you abuse your pet they will become aggressive, if you neglect your pet they will become distraught, a mistreated animal is very
            dangerous and these are the ones you see on the news all the time. The dogs that have been abused or are trained to be aggressive, which mind you
            is not the majority are getting all the attention.</p>

        <p>As you can see from the video Dobermans are no more dangerous than your local butterfly. These two
        are buddies and one just figured out that the other likes treats.</p>
